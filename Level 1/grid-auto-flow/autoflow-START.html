    ** When you open this one up in your browser, you'll notice
    ** that the elements keep going of way of the page creating 
    ** a horizontal scrollbar. That's because we define special
    ** rules for the first and second column, most likely because 
    ** we don't know how many elements it is going be since they 
    ** might be generated dynamically. 
    
    ** That's where auto-flow comes into play. With auto-flow you 
    ** define in what direction all "extra" elements should line up.
    ** By default grid-auto-flow is row, which makes the elements 
    ** align beneath each other. Try commenting out grid-auto-flow
    ** and see what happens. 

    ** The grid-auto-columns and grid-auto-rows is where you define
    ** the width or height of the rows and columns that are not defined
    ** from the begining. As with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
    ** you can define more than one rule. For instance is you set
    ** grid-auto-colums: 150px 300px 50px; In our case, the third
    ** column would receive the width of 150px, the fourth 300px
    ** and the fifth 50px. What about the sixth? Well the rules 
    ** just start over giving the sixth the width of 150px, the
    ** seventh 300px an so on.

    ** So with this exercise, play around with grid-auto-columns
    ** and grid-auto-rows, add more elements and see how they line up.

    ** Good Luck! =)

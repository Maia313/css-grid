  ** In this case it depends on how you want the items to behave.
  ** The look kind of similiar, but the difference is that in the 
  ** flex container all items will always have the same width as
  ** flex: 1; makes sure they share the width equally. Now, you 
  ** going to say hold up! One item is bigger than the rest? 
  ** And that is true. That is because words doesn't break unless
  ** you set word-break: break-all or break-word;

    ** In this exercise we are going to take a closer look
    ** at aligning and centering items. If you got any 
    ** experience with flexbox, then some of this is going 
    ** to be familiar. In CSS Grid we got three different 
    ** ways of aligning items. -items, -content and -self.
    ** All these will have either justify or align infront 
    ** of it. By default all of these are set to stretch.

      Content
    ** justify and align-content is used to place the grid
    ** container. For this to have any effect, the grid 
    ** container has to be smaller than the container surronding
    ** it. 
    
      Items
    ** justify and align-items define how each item should 
    ** line up. By changing justify or align-items to for 
    ** instance center, the items will be shrunk to only 
    ** take up the space of its content, including padding
    ** etc. Change it to justify-items: end; will place all
    ** items at the end of its column and size it back out.

      Self
    ** justify and align-self is when you want to target an
    ** item individually. You will be familiar with how 
    ** align-self works if you got any flexbox experience.
    ** justify-self works the same way but horizontally.

    ** As a shourtcut, you can instead use place- ahead of 
    ** all three rules. place- is going to render out in this
    ** order, align-[rule] and justify-[rule]. So by setting
    ** place-self: center end; is going to set the individual
    ** item to align center vertically and at the end of the
    ** column horizontally.
    
    ** If both align and justify will have the same rule, like:
    ** place-items: center; will result in justify-items: center;
    ** and align-items: center;

    ** The most common values you are going to use is center,
    ** end or flex-end, start or flex-start.

    ** Now go ahead and play around with the different rules
    ** to get to know them better.

    ** Good Luck! =)
